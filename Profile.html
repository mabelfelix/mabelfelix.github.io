<section class="secondheader">About Me</section>
<p>I live in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico and recently graduated from Loretto Academy High School in El Paso, Texas. This fall, I'll be going to Princeton University, where I hope to earn a degree in Computer Engineering. During my spare time I like to read, listen to music, and look at puppy videos (although they may not all really be puppies, all dogs are puppers to me), which is why I have a bunch of links to fun stuff about these topics. </p>
